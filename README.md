# HPCC: High Precision Congestion Control

## Overview
HPCC, a new high-speed CC mechanism, achieves ultra-low latency, high bandwidth, and network stability simultaneously. HPCC leverages in-network telemetry (INT) to obtain precise link load information and controls traffic precisely. HPCC can quickly converge to utilize free bandwidth while avoiding congestion, and can maintain near-zero in-network queues for ultra-low latency.

HPCC has been deployed in Alibaba. It shortens the flow completion times by up to 95% compared to the previous generation CC (DCQCN) for datacenters.
